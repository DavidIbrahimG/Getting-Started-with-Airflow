# ðŸ§® Airflow Math Operations DAG

This project demonstrates a simple Apache Airflow DAG that performs a sequence of basic mathematical operations using `PythonOperator`.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The DAG consists of 5 tasks executed in sequence:

1. **Start Number** â€“ Initializes the value to `10`.
2. **Add Five** â€“ Adds 5 to the initial number.
3. **Multiply by Two** â€“ Multiplies the result by 2.
4. **Subtract Three** â€“ Subtracts 3 from the new value.
5. **Complete Square** â€“ Squares the final result.

Each task passes its result to the next using **XComs**, showcasing how data can flow between tasks in Airflow.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Airflow installed and initialized.
2. Copy the DAG file (`mlpipeline.py`) into your Airflow `dags/` directory.
3. Start the Airflow scheduler and webserver:
   ```bash
   airflow scheduler
   airflow webserver

4. Trigger the DAG manually or let it run on its defined schedule (@daily).

### ðŸ›  Requirements
    Python 3.7+

    Apache Airflow 2.x or 3.x

ðŸ“Œ Note: Remove provide_context=True if you're on Airflow 2+ or later â€” context is passed automatically.
